# 🎓 Teachers Rating Dataset Analysis  

## 🧭 Objective  
The goal of this practical exercise is to analyze a **synthetic dataset of teachers’ ratings** using Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.  
The analysis involves exploring statistical relationships, creating visualizations, and interpreting key factors that may influence teaching evaluations — such as **age**, **gender**, **beauty**, and **tenure**.
