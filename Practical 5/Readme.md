# ðŸŽ“ Teachers Rating Dataset Analysis

## ðŸ§­ Objective

The purpose of this practical is to apply probability and hypothesis testing concepts using the Teachersâ€™ Rating Dataset. Students will calculate probabilities of evaluation scores within specific ranges and conduct a two-tailed Z-test to compare sample means with a known population mean.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description
The dataset named ratings contains details of university professors and their corresponding teaching evaluation ratings.
It includes both demographic and professional information related to each professor.

| **eval**     | Overall teaching evaluation score (scale of 1â€“5)                           |
| **beauty**   | Numerical score representing the perceived attractiveness of the professor |
| **rating**   | Average teaching performance rating                                        |

| **tenure**   | Indicates whether the professor is tenured (Yes/No)                        |
| **division** | Type of course taught (Lower or Upper division)                            |

## ðŸ§¾ Results Summary
| Analysis                | Description                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P(eval > 4.5)**       | Probability of professors receiving evaluation scores greater than 4.5                            |
| **P(3.5 < eval < 4.2)** | Probability of professors having evaluation scores between 3.5 and 4.2                            |
| **Z-Test Result**       | Determines if the mean score of regional players significantly differs from the professional mean |
