# ðŸŽ“ Student Rating Dataset Analysis

## ðŸ§­ Objective
The aim of this practical is to analyze a **Student Rating Dataset** using Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.  
The task includes performing statistical analysis, data visualization, and interpretation of various factors influencing teaching evaluations â€” including **tenure status**, **age**, **gender**, and **minority representation**.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about **university professors** and their **student evaluation ratings**.  
Each record represents one professor along with demographic and professional details.

| Column       | Description                                                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **minority** | Indicates whether the professor belongs to a visible minority group (Yes/No) |
| **tenure**   | Tenure status of the professor â€” whether they are tenured (Yes) or not (No)  |
| **age**      | Age of the professor in years                                                |
| **gender**   | Gender of the professor (Male/Female)                                        |
| **eval**     | Evaluation score given by students (typically on a 1â€“5 scale)                |

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used

| Tool/Library | Purpose |
|---------------|----------|
| **Python (v3.x)** | Core programming language used for analysis |
| **pandas** | Data loading, cleaning, and manipulation |
| **NumPy** | Numerical computations and descriptive statistics |
| **Matplotlib (Pyplot)** | Visualization of data distributions and categorical variables |
| **Seaborn** | Enhanced plotting and styling of graphs |
| **Google Colab** | Interactive environment for coding and visualization |

## ðŸ§¾ Results Summary

- The **percentage of visible minorities with tenure** was calculated and compared with non-minority faculty to analyze representation.  
- **Tenured professors** had a **higher average age** and greater standard deviation, indicating more experience.  
- **Histograms** effectively displayed the age distribution, revealing the spread and central tendency.  
- **Bar charts** were used to illustrate gender ratios using both `bar()` and `barh()`.  
- The **median evaluation score** for tenured professors was computed to summarize their student-rated performance.
