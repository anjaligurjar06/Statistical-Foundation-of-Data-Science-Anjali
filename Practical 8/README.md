# 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier — Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

## 🧭 Objective
The aim of this practical is to **classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic** using the **Decision Tree algorithm** on the **Pima Indians Diabetes dataset**.  
The experiment explores how different health-related factors such as **Glucose**, **BMI**, and **Age** contribute to diabetes prediction.  
Both **Entropy (Information Gain)** and **Gini Index** criteria are used to evaluate model performance and determine the best root node.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset named **`diabetes.csv`** contains diagnostic measurements of female Pima Indian patients aged 21 years or older.  
It is used to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on certain physiological features.

| Column | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Pregnancies** | Number of times the patient was pregnant |
| **Glucose** | Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours |
| **BloodPressure** | Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) |
| **SkinThickness** | Triceps skin fold thickness (mm) |
| **Insulin** | 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) |
| **BMI** | Body Mass Index (weight in kg / height in m²) |
| **DiabetesPedigreeFunction** | Diabetes heredity function score |
| **Age** | Age of the individual (years) |
| **Outcome** | Target variable — 0 (Non-diabetic), 1 (Diabetic) |

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Loading and Exploration
- Load the dataset using **pandas** and examine its structure, missing values, and summary statistics.

### 2️⃣ Feature Selection
- Independent variables: All columns except `Outcome`  
- Dependent variable: `Outcome`

### 3️⃣ Train-Test Split
- Split data for training and testing.

### 4️⃣ Model Building
- Build two models using DecisionTreeClassifier:

```python
  dt_entropy = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='entropy', max_depth=3, random_state=42)
  dt_gini = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='gini', max_depth=3, random_state=42)
```
### 5️⃣ Visualization
- Visualized both the decision trees.

### 6️⃣ Manual Calculation
- Compute Entropy, Information Gain, and Gini Index for the feature Glucose to verify root node selection.

## 🧾 Results Summary

| Criterion      | Root Node | Accuracy | Remarks                  |
| -------------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| **Entropy**    | Glucose   | ~75%     | Highest Information Gain |
| **Gini Index** | Glucose   | ~75%     | Highest Gini Reduction   |

-Both criteria produced similar accuracy and tree structures.
-Glucose was identified as the root node due to maximum impurity reduction.
-BMI and Age appeared as secondary splitting factors.

## 🧮 Key Formulas Used

## 📊 Entropy, Gini Index, and Information Gain

### 🔹 Entropy
Entropy measures the impurity or uncertainty in a dataset.  
It is calculated using the formula:

**Entropy = − Σ ( pᵢ × log₂(pᵢ) )**

Where:  
- *pᵢ* = probability of class *i*

---

### 🔹 Gini Index
The Gini Index measures the impurity in a dataset and is calculated as:

**Gini = 1 − Σ ( pᵢ² )**

Where:  
- *pᵢ* = probability of class *i*

---

### 🔹 Information Gain
Information Gain (IG) represents the reduction in entropy after splitting the dataset based on an attribute.  
It is calculated as:

**IG = Entropy(parent) − Σ ( (n_child / n_total) × Entropy(child) )**

Where:  
- *Entropy(parent)* = Entropy of the original dataset  
- *n_child* = number of samples in each child node  
- *n_total* = total number of samples before the split  
- *Entropy(child)* = Entropy after the split

## 🏁 Conclusion

This practical demonstrated the use of Decision Tree Classifiers with both Entropy and Gini Index criteria.
Both models identified Glucose as the most significant feature for diabetes prediction.
The key learnings include:
  - Building and interpreting Decision Trees
  - Understanding Entropy, Information Gain, and Gini Index
  - Visualizing splits for clear interpretability

Decision Trees provided an intuitive and explainable way to predict medical outcomes effectively.
